## Table of contents

You can find the following notebooks in this repository:

- notebooks/1_introduction_to_pyiron_workflow.ipynb
- notebooks/2_murnaghan.ipynb
- notebooks/3_elasticity.ipynb
- notebooks/4_full_implementation.ipynb

You should be able to understand the first three notebooks without any prior knowledge of `pyiron_workflow`. The last notebook is to show you the full implementation of the workflow(-s), which in principle you should be able to create yourself after getting a short introduction with the first notebook.
